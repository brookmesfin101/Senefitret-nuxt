he was about to leave the country. He tried to cure himself with medicines he

Germination of indigenous tree seeds, long considered a difficulty in tree

notwithstanding, the country clearly needs a careful and systematic study of
its plant life both to value its resources and to develop an intelligent development
and conservation strategy. The efforts of the Ethiopian Flora and Ecology
Projects, a joint undertaking between AAU and the Universities of Uppsala in Sweden
and Copenhagen in Denmark, are perhaps the most significant collaborative
efforts in this regard. These Projects, which started in 1980 and 1987,
respectively, in addition to surveying the higher plant species in Ethiopia and the ecology of selected parts of the country, are also attempting to lay the
foundation for a long-term study of the Ethiopian vegetation. So far seven
volumes covering about 90 % of the species in the country have been published
under the Flora Project. This Project, in particular, has trained personnel,
the majority to the level of Ph.D., and has improved the research capability of
the site of the Projects, the National Herbarium in the Department of Biology,
by increasing the number of research specimens available to the National
Herbarium from about 16,000 in 1980 to over 100,000 in the early 2000s, by
establishing and maintaining a research library and by acquiring important
equipment and supplies. By publishing the Flora volumes within Ethiopia, the Project has assured their sale at affordable prices within the country and
also supplied over 1,000 copies of each volume freely to the Ministry of
Education to be distributed to high schools throughout the country. The
Projects also maintain good relationships with institutions particularly in
Europe (Austria, Frankfurt, Firenze, London, Paris, and Uppsala) that have historical
collections of Ethiopian plants, such as those gathered by the German plant
collector, Wilhelm G. Schimper, from Tigray and Gonder from 1838 to about 1878.
Indirectly, the Project has also helped train botanists from Sudan,
 Kenya and Tanzania and technicians from various institutions in Ethiopia. If developed further, the National Herbarium could become a botanical research
centre not only for Ethiopia but also for countries in North-East and East
tropical Africa.</span></b></p>

plants have shown. As a result of this negligence, with the exception of a few
patches of forests here and there and particularly in conjunction with the
proclamations set forth to delineate National Parks and wild life sanctuaries,
there has never been a comprehensive program of conservation and development of
vegetation in Ethiopia. This is apparent from the figures that are often quoted
about the status of forests in Ethiopia: &quot;of the original 35% forest
cover, 16% was left by 1952, 3.6% by 1980, 2.7% by 1987 and about 2.4% by
1990&quot;. Only a few forests, which were under private ownership, such as
that in Anabe in Wello, and under government control such as the Menagesha
forest in Shewa and Yegof forest in Wello, are well preserved. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Times-Bold",serif;color:#333333'>What are the constraints to conservation
and development? It is always difficult to give a clear cut answer to such
questions. However, the land-tenure system is central to understanding and
resolving the problem. A historical account of environmental degradation,
particularly in northern Ethiopia, indicates that degradation was caused mainly
by the changes in the social organization and in land holding system which
allocated all land other than that under cultivation to communal ownership. </span></b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-autospace:none'><b><span style='font-size:11.5pt;
font-family:"Times-Bold",serif;color:#333333'>Communally owned land in northern
  Ethiopia was unscrupulously exploited and later neglected. That is why we
come across extensive areas of bare land in northern Ethiopia today. That form
of land ownership, used later in the central and southern parts of the country,
has failed to allocate clearly both the right to use of land and the
responsibility to care for it, except in areas such as those inhabited by the
Konso people in southern Ethiopia. This lack of responsibility and accountability
also helps explain why, during periods of unstable or transitional governments,
many forests, woodlands and plantations are put to fire, wildlife conservation
sites threatened and facilities therein ransacked. Perhaps, then, the answer
lies in a different form of land ownership. For example, in the developed parts
of the world, government controlled land is considered “publicly&quot; owned.
The public is made aware of its rights and responsibilities as to the use of
the land and its produce, and is prohibited from using such property in a
manner inconsistent with its legally designated uses. Thus, certain areas are
set aside for recreational use only, whereas others may be forested or mined so
long as the government is compensated. The government also provides the
necessary personnel and facilities, including infrastructure for research and development
to maintain the continued existence of vegetation and other wildlife on public
property. Through establishing or participating in learned societies, these
governmental institutions increase the awareness and participation of the
public in maintaining this property.</span></b></p>

property? Even if this is assumed to be so, has the government created outlets
for the public's demands for produce from the land? Has the level of awareness
of the public been elevated to the extent that the public would take communal land
as its own property and would take care of it? Have the governmental institutions
been able to carry out their responsibilities in manners that are satisfactory
