Many people might wonder what <b>September 11</b> <b>or 9/11</b> has
to do with Ethiopia, a country so remote geographically from New
York, where the infamous crashing of passenger airliners into the
twin towers by terrorists happened. Many in Ethiopia, particularly
those residing in cities, know about that but many outside of
Ethiopia may not know what happens on <b>September 11</b> of each
year, except in leap years. On leap years, the New Ethiopian Year
will be on September 12 because the 13<sup>th</sup> month of the
year, the shortest month and called <b>Pagumeé,</b> will have 6 days
instead of 5. According to the Ethiopian calendar, <b>MESKEREM</b> is
the first month of the 13 months in the year. Each month is 30 days
long except for the 13<sup>th</sup> month, which is 5 or 6 (in leap
years) days long.</p>

To many people in the western world, Ethiopia is known for its
ancient glories as well as for its place in world affairs
particularly during and after the Second World War. Yet, to many
others, Ethiopia is also portrayed as a place of perpetual hunger and
civil strife. Although these are undeniable, there are more to what
may come out of Ethiopia, a country with a mosaic of free-spirited,
peace-loving, and caring people. <b>September 11</b> (<b>MESKEREM 1</b>;
or <b>September 12</b> every leap year) and also sixteen days later
on September 27 (<b>MESKEREM</b> 16 or 17), the day commemorating the
finding of the ‘<b>True Cross</b>’ are holidays celebrated by
nearly all Ethiopians living both in and out of the country. What
makes this day great is also the fact that much of the plateau, many
river valleys, hills and mountain slopes in Ethiopia are covered,
especially from September to November, by the <b>yellow-flowered</b>
species of plants known as <i><b>Adey Abeba</b></i>. These plants
belong to the family of plants known commonly as daisies and
specifically to the plant genus scientifically known as <i><b>Bidens</b></i>.
In certain places, including the capital city, Addis Abeba, these
plants grow in large masses forming dense covers and resembling
cultivated fields. To many people in Ethiopia, they signify the end
of the long, rainy season and the beginning of the dry and sunny
season.

The yellow color, in the Ethiopian culture as well as in many other
cultures, is a symbol of <b>love, peace and hope</b>. So, the
coincidental flowering of <i><b>Adey Abeba</b></i> at about the end
of the summer rains in September, i.e., the beginning of the New Year
in Ethiopia, during which also followers of the [Orthodox] Christian
religion celebrate the finding of the ‘True Cross’ have made some
of them important in the festal activities of the Ethiopians. At
about the same time, a bird called Ye Meskel Wof is also quite
commonly seen in many places. A short documentary about it was aired
on the Ethiopian TV on 6 October 2011 under the title “DO u know
about Ye Meskel Wef?’ and readers are encouraged to watch that
clip. The following poem by author Mengistu Lemma is relevant here:</p>

The most widespread species of Bidens is <i><b>Bidens prestinaria,
</b></i>commonly known as<i><b> Adey Abeba</b></i> (in Amharic/Ge’ez;
<i>Ghelghele Meskel</i> or <i>Tsselim-Teneg</i> in Tigrignia and
<i>Qello</i> in Oromigna/Oromiffa – two other major languages in
the country). This species, along with a few other similar-looking
species, is displayed as a <b>symbol of hope and love</b>, also
signifying the end of the rainy season and the beginning of the New
Year. Bouquets of the species are often presented to families or
friends as gifts. Together with grasses and sedges, they are also
used in decorating house floors, particularly during household or
communal coffee ceremonies particularly on the Ethiopian New Year.

Here, I offer an explanation on the Amharic/Ge’ez names: <i><b>Adey</b></i>
in Tigrignia means “<b>mother</b>” and probably “<i><b>Adey
Abeba</b></i>” was used to mean that it is the “<b>mother of all
flowers</b>.” I do not know whether the Tigrayans used this name in
the past and that it has now been replaced by <i><b>Tseelim-Teneg</b></i>.
I have no information. If readers know about it, let us know.</p>

Since a long time ago Ethiopia has supplied the world with a variety
of plants including coffee, barley, oil producing plants, spices,
incense producing plants, etc. Currently it is also supplying the
world with its staple food plant, <b>TEFF</b> or <i><b>Eragrostis
tef</b></i>, a member of the grass family, which is found to possess
good qualities including the absence of <b>gluten</b>, the sticky
chemical found in wheat, for example. I am sure one day, <i><b>Adey
Abeba</b></i> will have a similar target. 
</p>
<p class="western" align="justify" style="text-indent: 0.5in; margin-bottom: 0in; border: none; padding: 0in; line-height: 100%">
I am sure Ethiopians would like to join me in extending their love
and best wishes during the Ethiopian New Year to citizens of the
world and all peace-loving people for a better world by sending their
symbol of love and hope, <b>Adey Abeba.</b></p>
